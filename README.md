# Surf n' Shake

## Overview 
While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a new found passion for surfing. I want to be able live in Hawaii and so I've come up with a business idea for a Surf n' Shake shop, serving surf boards and ice cream to locals and tourists. I need investor backing to get this off the ground and luckily W. Avy is a big fan of surfing but has one concern about the weather throughout the year. I've created an analysis however W. Avy would like more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if Surf n' Shake is going to be sustainable year-round. The following analysis will include:
* Summary temperature statistics for June.
* Summary temperature statistics for December.

## Results
Below are the results from both months of June and December

* The average temperature in the month of June is ~ 75 degreees, which is ~ 4 degrees higher than Decembers average temperature.
* The main difference between these two months is their minimum temperatures. June's minimum temperature is a nice and comfortable 64 degrees, while December's is a slightly more chilly 56 degrees.
* The maximum temperature of both months are fairly even with June's being at 85 degrees and December's being at 83 degrees.
* There is quite a bit more temperature recordings for June (1,700) than there is for December (1,513).
* Both months have a standard deviation over 3. This suggests that there is possibility of variation, a change in temperatures, for both months.

## Summary 
From the temperature data that was gathered for June and December it can be concluded that there is not much of a difference between the two months. This leads me to infer that the Surf n' Shake business will be able to succeed year round, outside of a handful of bad weather days. Since December has a minimum temperature of 56 degrees, it may not be ideal for locals and tourists to enjoy surfing and ice cream on those hanful of cold December days. In addition to analyzing the temperature data, I decided to dive a little deeper and gather the precipitation (rain) data for both months provided below.

* The tables above show that December has significantly more rain than June. The average rainfall for December is ~ 0.22 inches and a maximum of 6.4 inches. 
* On the other hand, June averages ~0.14 inches of rain, which is ~ 64% less precipitation per day. 
* December's maximum rainfall per day is ~ 69% higher than June's, which could deter customers from venturing out for an icecream or a day surfing the waves. 
* In conclusion, the rainfall in December while being significantly higher than June will not drastically affect my business model and W. Avy is more than happy to hop onboard with this business venture. 
### Here's to living in paradise, ripping waves, and enjoying delicious ice cream treats!!
